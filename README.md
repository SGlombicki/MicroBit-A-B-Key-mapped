# MicroBit-A-B-Key-mapped
This project contains the code i used to make the A and B key mapped to up arrow and down arrow you can go in and change it if you wish. Main.py is the remaper and Moue.py is tells you what key was pressed. At the moment this only works on the tiny screen later i will make this work better and be better. Miniscreen is for the dev enviorment and has diffent key mappings a to a and b to b and up arrow to a and down arrow to b. It is the same thing for emulator but for my emulator on my website
